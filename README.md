# DataProducts

This repo contains the server.R and ui.R files for a Data Product developed for the Coursera Data Science Specialization.

The code is designed to run on "Shiny", for instance on shinyapps.io.

To run the App yourself, in addition to "Shiny" server, you need the dataset which is available from:

https://www.kaggle.com/usdot/flight-delays

The dataset must be placed in the same folder as 'ui.R' and 'server.R' and must be called 'flight-delays'.
