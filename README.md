# DataProducts

This repo contains the server.R and ui.R files for a Data Product developed for the Coursera Data Science Specialization.

The code is designed to run on "Shiny", for instance on shinyapps.io.

To run the App yourself, in addition to "Shiny" server, you need the dataset which is available from:

https://www.kaggle.com/usdot/flight-delays

The dataset must be placed in the same folder as 'ui.R' and 'server.R' and must be called 'flight-delays'.  
Context: The U.S. Department of Transportation's (DOT) Bureau of Transportation Statistics tracks the on-time performance of domestic flights operated by large air carriers. Summary information on the number of on-time, delayed, canceled, and diverted flights is published in DOT's monthly Air Travel Consumer Report and in this dataset of 2015 flight delays and cancellations.
